#  ClipSync: Seamless Universal Clipboard

**ClipSync** is the ultimate tool to synchronize your clipboard across Android and Mac—**instantly** and **securely**. Copy on your Mac, paste on your Android. It's that simple. 

>  **Open Source, Secure, and Blazing Fast.**

##  Features

*   **Instant Sync**: Copy text on one device and it’s immediately available on the other. No extra buttons or annoying persistant notification to click on android to send the clipboard, just copy anything normally and paste it directly on the Mac OR the other way around. 
*   **End-to-End Encryption**: Your data is encrypted with AES-256(GCM) locally before it leaves your device and decryted locally on each device before getting copied to the .clipboard.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Seamlessly works between **macOS** and **Android**. 
*   **Efficient**: Optimized for minimal battery drain and background usage.  
*   **Stunning UI**: Beautiful, native designs for both platforms.
